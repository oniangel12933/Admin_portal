<i>Invoice Ninja</i> is an invoicing application that makes sending invoices and receiving payments simple and easy. Our latest version is a clean slate rewrite of our popular invoicing application which builds on the existing feature set and adds a wide range of features and enhancements that you have asked for.

We're similar to WordPress, you can either run the app on our server (hosted) or on your own server (selfhosted) â€“ the server-part is built with PHP/Laravel; many people use Docker or Cloudron to install a packaged version, but you also can install it manually.
